This repo contains source code demonstrating the use of the GrainyPy
([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/grainypy), [GitHub](https://github.com/ldo/grainypy))
Python module. Currently there is only one example script, dither_comparison, which shows
off various dithering algorithms.

Sample output from this script can be seen on my on my [DeviantArt
account](https://default-cube.deviantart.com/gallery/56848197/GrainyPy-Examples).
